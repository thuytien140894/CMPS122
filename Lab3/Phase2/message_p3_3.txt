devouring time blunt thou the lions paws
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws
and burn the longlived phoenix in her blood
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst
and do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted time
to the wide world and all her fading sweets
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beautys pattern to succeeding men
  yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
  my love shall in my verse ever live young

tithho
